# Opcode Based Malware Detection Tensorflow
Runtime opcode based deep learning aided malware detection. CNN, LSTM- RNN, Transformer, autoencoder and Word2Vec embeddings implemented on assembly opcode sequence data.
Thousands of new malware codes are developed every day. Signature-based methods, which are employed by common malware detectors, are susceptible to code obfuscation and novel malware. In this paper, we present an alternative method for malware detection which makes use of assembly opcode sequences or frequencies obtained during runtime. Firstly, for sequential opcode data, we utilize natural language processing and deep learning techniques to facilitate the extraction of deeper behavioral features. Due to these features, this method can be impervious to code obfuscation and effective against novel malware. Finally, these features are fed to various machine learning algorithms for classification. The experiments on 26027 samples that were conducted demonstrated high MCC (Matthew Correlation Coefficient) scores are achievable with this approach. Secondly, for frequency dataset, we conduct another experiment that indicates the runtime opcode approach can achieve \%70 accuracy for 16 malware labels on 59424 samples.
